# Phone-Number-Information-Tracking-System
TO use thia you have to download the zip file and then you have to install few packags ans run. 
This was created by me back in 2021 while i was in college. One of the major drawback is that he location is static you have to enter it by urself back then i ws more in DSA and java so i wasnt able to fully complete this project but still this is one of my first project so i like it. 
You have to install few packages like phonumber,gepcoder,opencage,folium.geopy and you have to emnter your API key or YOu can use mine also. the map will be in your home,.html.
Happy Coding Guys.
